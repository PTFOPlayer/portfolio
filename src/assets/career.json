    "text": "It is complicated because I didn't stop working at Atmar technically, but it's not regular job. I am going there whenever their main technician is not available or there is need for more workforce with broad knowlage of hardware (it is episodical). On avarage I'm working there probably arround one full week in a month. At this point I am no longer only packing ready product but I am substitute for main technician, that's because I really quickly learned everything I could about hardware. They even send me to some training courses!"

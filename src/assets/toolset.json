      "description": "This one is my favourite programming language. It gives me ability to develop software quicly and reliably, because i don't have to worry about memory safty thanks to borrow checker, and handling exception thanks to compiler. Robust type system gives me confidency in code that i am writing."

      "description": "I don't really us it very often, I like it because software written in it is easy to revrite in Rust. I have some projects written in it but i generaly try avoiding C++ as much as I can, but I learned it still because i wanted to have something closer to hardware like C but with modern features and capabilities to use OOP."

When it comes to React, I choose it over angular because it was easier for me to use. Scss / Sass whas chosen by me because I already knew CSS but i wanted to have some more capabilities than that offered by plain CSS. "
